# **Terms of Service**

These terms of service ("Terms") constitute a binding agreement and apply to your ("You" or "User") usage of[ www.uncap.finance](http://www.uncap.finance) ("Site") offered by Uncap Labs GmbH ("Uncap Labs"), a software development company. The Site provides information and access to Uncap, a fully open and permissionless DeFi protocol consisting of a BTC-backed CDP stablecoin (USDU) and a ve(3,3) incentive mechanism allowing anyone to deploy and interact with Bitcoin-denominated financial services (together with any related technology the "Protocol").

The Protocol is not offered, controlled, or operated by Uncap Labs, and these Terms do not govern Your use of the Protocol, which You do so entirely at Your own risk. Please refer to the Protocol Disclaimer below.

## **Scope of Services**

Uncap Labs's services offered through the Site are limited to the following ("Services"):

- **Informational content**: The Site provides informational content and documentation regarding the functionalities and potential use cases of the Protocol. You understand and acknowledge that any content, including any references to the Protocol and its functionalities (e.g., APYs on USDU stability pools, borrowing rates, or liquidity incentives) or accompanying documentation published on the Site is of purely informational nature. In particular, none of the content of the Site is to be understood as professional or non-professional advice, including but not limited to financial, investment, legal, or tax advice by Uncap Labs or any third party. Furthermore, such content should not be construed as an offer or recommendation for lending, borrowing, minting stablecoins, or otherwise dealing in crypto assets.

- **Facilitated Protocol access**: The Site allows facilitated interaction with the various smart contracts that constitute the Protocol. You understand and acknowledge that:

  - The Site acts merely as an off-chain interface, whereby the functionalities are limited to visualizing and displaying information obtained from the Protocol (or from other sources) and proposing interactions based entirely on the User's own input. Users interact by connecting a compatible address (using third party software) and, using their own private keys, signing interactions visualized by the interface.

  * The Protocol is entirely separate from the interaction offered via the Site, and as the Site is an off-chain component, remains unaffected and is not in any way dependent on the Site. By controlling the Site, Uncap Labs does not exercise control over the Protocol.

  * Your use of the Site to interact with the Protocol is without any sort of remuneration, fee, or other form of compensation to Uncap Labs. Uncap Labs does not intend to construe or enter into any sort of (permanent) business relationship with You relating to Your use of the Site.

  * Your use of the Site to interact with the Protocol is entirely optional, and You are entirely free to access the Protocol in any other way such as using any third party interface.

These Terms and Your use of the Services are not intended to create any fiduciary duties between Uncap Labs and You or any third party. Uncap Labs never takes possession, custody, control, or ownership of any crypto assets or other property transmitted by You. Uncap Labs is not a provider of financial services, and specifically does not grant loans, mint stablecoins, or offer any sort of payment, trading, asset management, or similar services.

The Protocol is a DeFi application, and any third party can integrate the Protocol (or part thereof) into its own protocol, application, services, or similar (subject to the Protocol license terms). Any reference to such integration is made by Uncap Labs for informational purposes only. Unless specifically indicated otherwise by Uncap Labs, Uncap Labs is not involved in, does not control, support, endorse, audit, or monitor any such third party integration.

## **Protocol Disclaimer**

If You are accessing or using the Protocol, please note the following:

**No legal claim**: All functionalities of the Protocol are of a purely technical nature, are not associated with, and do not convey any legal claim toward any entity, individual, or group of individuals, including but not limited to Uncap Labs, any of its representatives or any individual or group of Uncap project contributors, team members, and similar persons.

**No operation and no relationship**: The Protocol has been deployed and runs in an open and autonomous manner on Starknet (and potentially other networks). While Uncap Labs is a contributor, Uncap Labs is not responsible for the operation, the running, or the functioning of the Protocol or for any interactions, collaborations, or mere factual relationships between users and the smart contracts of the Protocol or between users themselves. Any usage of the term 'we', 'our', etc. in this context is purely semantic and not to be understood as an assumption of ownership of the Protocol.

**No control**: Uncap Labs has neither access to nor any possibility to control and/or influence any transactions, deposits, borrowing, or minting made by users using the Protocol. Any assets potentially placed with the smart contracts of the Protocol are in the sole control and subject to the sole logic of the respective smart contracts, and cannot be accessed by Uncap Labs or any third party. There is no operational dependency of the Protocol on Uncap Labs.

**No partnership**: Uncap Labs has not and will not enter into any legal or factual relationship with any user of the Protocol. Users do not agree and do not state their will to enter into or create a simple partnership, joint venture, or similar sort of legal structure by using the Protocol.

**Assumption of risks**: The User understands and acknowledges that the Protocol, in particular, and smart contracts, blockchains, cryptographic tokens, and related systems and software, in general, are nascent, experimental, inherently risky, and subject to change. In order to understand the risks associated with using the Protocol, as well as any other blockchain-based technology, users are strongly encouraged to get acquainted with the underlying protocols as much as possible. You bear sole responsibility for all risks associated with accessing, using, and interacting with the Protocol, which include, but are not limited to:

- Any crypto assets used in connection with the Protocol are at risk of being lost indefinitely (due to various reasons including errors, bugs, hacks, etc.), without any kind of consideration.

- While accessing the Protocol, there is a possibility that Your crypto assets could depreciate partially or entirely in value. Borrowing through the Protocol requires that You provide Your own crypto assets as security. In the event that the value of Your security fails to adequately cover Your borrowings, Your collateral may be seized by others through liquidation. You acknowledge that Uncap Labs accepts no liability for any of these circumstances or risks, as we neither possess nor control the Protocol. Transactions entered in connection with the Protocol are irreversible, and final and there are no refunds. Any transactions by You are unsolicited and solely initiated, and their outcome is solely borne, by, You.

- The Protocol involves minting and using USDU, a BTC-backed stablecoin. Stablecoins carry risks including but not limited to depegging, smart contract vulnerabilities, and liquidation risks. The stability mechanism relies on market forces and protocol incentives which may not always function as intended.

- The Protocol includes a ve(3,3) incentive mechanism and governance token (UNCAP). Token values can be highly volatile and may lose value entirely. Governance tokens carry additional risks related to protocol governance decisions and potential changes to tokenomics.

- The Protocol is non-custodial. You are solely responsible for implementing reasonable measures to secure access to the wallet solution (i.e., private key(s) or other credentials) used to interact with Protocol or receive, hold, send, and use crypto assets.

- The Protocol could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the availability of the Protocol and your continued use of the Protocol. The Protocol has not been reviewed, registered, approved, or licensed by any regulatory agency or authority.

## **Limitation of Liability and Indemnity**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, UNCAP LABS IS NOT LIABLE TO ANY USER FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT AND INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE, IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF THE CRYPTO ASSETS OR TOKENS). Uncap Labs will not be held liable for the inaccuracy, incompleteness, or unavailability of the Services, or the incompatibility of the Services with any specific objectives that the User is hoping to achieve. The User acknowledges and agrees that the Protocol is an open-source project to which Uncap Labs has contributed, but cannot be held responsible for. No individual or groups of contributor(s), developer(s), entity(ies), any of such entity(ies) representatives or directors, or any other persons involved in any way with the Uncap project are liable to you for any claims or damages whatsoever.

You agree to indemnify and hold Uncap Labs harmless from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or arising out of (i) any breach of these Terms or any law or regulation applicable to You, Your affiliates, Your employees or any other persons acting Your behalf; (ii) any breach of any other agreement You are a party to, or (iii) Your violation of the rights of a third party.

## **Miscellaneous**

**Entire Agreement**: These Terms, including any additional documents that are incorporated into these Terms by reference (if any), constitute the entire agreement relating to your use of the Services. General terms and conditions of the User are excluded.

**Changes to Terms**: Uncap Labs may, from time to time, change these Terms in its sole discretion and without any prior announcement. The Terms at the time of use of Services apply.

**No Assignment**: The User may not assign any of its rights, obligations, or claims under the Terms without the previous written and express consent of Uncap Labs.

**Severability**: If any provision of the Terms (in whole or part) is held to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.

**Governing Law & Jurisdiction**: These Terms, and all claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arising out of, or relating to these Terms, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with substantive Swiss law, excluding its conflict of law provisions and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The ordinary courts at the seat of Uncap Labs have jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with the Terms.

**Class action and jury trial waiver**: You must bring any and all disputes against us in Your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding. This provision applies to class arbitration. You and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.
